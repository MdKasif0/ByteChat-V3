## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js (v18 or later) and npm/yarn installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bytechat.git
    cd bytechat
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase**
    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    - Inside your project, enable **Firestore**, **Authentication** (with Email/Password and Google providers), and **Storage**.
    - Navigate to Project Settings > General, and under "Your apps", create a new Web App.
    - Copy the `firebaseConfig` object.
    - Navigate to Project Settings > Service accounts and click "Generate new private key" to download your service account JSON file.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    - Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project. This file is ignored by Git and is safe for your secrets.
    - Populate it with your Firebase credentials from the previous steps.

    ```env
    # For client-side Firebase
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY=YOUR_WEB_PUSH_VAPID_KEY

    # For server-side Firebase (e.g., sending notifications)
    # Paste the entire content of your downloaded service account JSON file here.
    FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type": "service_account", ...}'
    ```

5.  **Run the development server**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.
